### App interoperability:
   **Conversion of my Data.json to FHIR Bundle of Immunization structure for my App**

**Overview**
This is designed to convert existing vaccination data into FHIR Bundles of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Immunization resources. The data is streamed from a specified ...localhost:5000/api/vaccinations. 

we accept standardized data through the post request where Fhir data and bundles are being sent to our app, we receive it, process it and store it in our json file or make use of some entries directly from api/vaccinations...

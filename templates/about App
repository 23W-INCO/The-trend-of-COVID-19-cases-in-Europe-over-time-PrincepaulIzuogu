The Director of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control: The Director of ECDC is responsible for leading the ECDC’s work in strengthening Europe’s defence against infectious disease.

A Problem the The Director of ECDC Encouters
The Director of ECDC would want an easy understanding overview in the disparities in vaccine distribution among various European countries comparing the total vaccinations in each European country to the poplation and total covid cases between the past two years (2021-2023) without going through the database or raw data.

My Solution
This project is the solution to this problem, The Director of ECDC can use this choropleth map to easily understand the distribution of vaccines across different European countries within the specified period of time, due to the data i selected for this visualization, it is easier for the Director of ECDC to identify the following: countries, date, total_cases, population, total_vaccinations, people_vaccinated, people_fully_vaccinated, total_vaccinations_per_hundred, people_vaccinated_per_hundred, and people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred for each and every European countries.

User Objectives
Users aim to:

Understand the overall distribution of vaccines in Europe.
Compare the total cases and vaccine distribution across different countries or regions.
compare the distributed vaccines to the total people fully vacinated.
To identify or rather, calculate how the next distribution would be done.
Visualization Strategy and how it help users achieve task effectively and efficiently
I use a choropleth map for the visualization and then heatmap for the colors, i think this visualization pattern i chose is the best because:

It provides a geographical representation of total cases.
The animation feature allows for the observation of temporal changes.
Users can interactively explore data for specific timeframes.
Additional Features
Filtering Options: Users can customize the timeframe for a more focused view.
Hover Information: Interactive tooltips provide detailed information about each country's total cases.
